Recycle Rush
---
> Robot code (the real one) for the 2015 FRC robotics competition.

This code is **archived**.

### Resurrection
There are a few things to note for those resurrecting this bot:
* It runs on the roboRIO, right?
* It was originally written in Eclipse.
* There is a deployable `FRCUserProgam.jar` in the GitHub releases.
* The original FRC libraries used have been extracted into /libs
  * You'll need to associate the JARs yourself.
  
As things stand, there is no easy way to build and deploy. There are two options:
* Download the 2015 WPILib into your $USER_HOME directory
* Swap the Ant-based build system for GradleRIO

### Revitalization
This code is a *bit* messy. For the sake of helping out future generations of programmers who may have to read this code, we'll eventually dig through and clean things up.
